# -Data-Analysis
This folder contains projects ranging from basic analysis to Intermidiate analysis ( Advance analysis , I will create with their own repositories). I frequently update it.


Extra1 [ðŸ”— AnÃ¡lisis de Netflix (90s)] https://github.com/Lalo8Ortiz/-Data-Analysis/blob/main/notebook.ipynb
Proyect 1  [ðŸ”— Basics Concepts Python] https://github.com/Lalo8Ortiz/-Data-Analysis/blob/main/proyecto%20spring%201.Generalidades%20Python.ipynb
Proyect 2 [ðŸ”— Play List analysis )]https://github.com/Lalo8Ortiz/-Data-Analysis/blob/main/P2%20Procesamiento%20de%20datos%20lista%20de%20reproduccion.ipynb  
In this project, you will test a hypothesis related to the musical preferences of two cities. This will be done by analyzing real online music streaming data to test the hypothesis below and compare user behavior in these two cities.

This involves analyzing real online music streaming data to compare user behavior in Springfield and Shelbyville. The project is divided into three stages, each with specific objectives.

In Stage 1, you will provide a general overview of the data and record your observations.
In Stage 2, you will preprocess the data by cleaning it.
Finally, in Stage 3, you will test the hypothesis by following the necessary programming steps to verify each statement and commenting on your results in the appropriate sections.

Proyect 3 [ðŸ”— Deliveries grocery Instacart ) https://github.com/Lalo8Ortiz/-Data-Analysis/blob/main/P3Deliveries%20%20Instacart.ipynb 
Instacart is a grocery delivery platform where customers can place orders and have them delivered, similar to Uber Eats and DoorDash. The dataset provided has been modified from the original version. The size has been reduced to speed up computations, and missing values and duplicates have been introduced. These modifications were made carefully to preserve the original data distributions. 

The analysis consists of three main steps. For each step, a clear introduction will be provided to outline the approach taken. Additionally, explanatory paragraphs will be included to justify the decisions made throughout the process. Finally, a conclusion will summarize the key findings and methodological choices.

Proyect 4 [ðŸ”— Megaline telecommunications company ) https://github.com/Lalo8Ortiz/-Data-Analysis/blob/main/P4_Telecomunicaciones_Megaline_.ipynb
As an analyst for the telecommunications company Megaline, your task is to evaluate the performance of two prepaid plans: Surf and Ultimate. The marketing department wants to determine which plan generates more revenue to optimize the advertising budget.

You will conduct a preliminary analysis based on a sample of 500 customers, examining their usage patterns and revenue contributions. The dataset contains customer demographics, location, subscription type, call durations, and the number of text messages sent in 2018. Your goal is to analyze customer behavior and identify which plan yields higher revenue.



Proyect 5  [ðŸ”— API basic charts)] https://github.com/Lalo8Ortiz/TT_Proyecto5.git

Proyect 6 [ðŸ”— Videogames Company ) https://github.com/Lalo8Ortiz/-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Proyecto_6_Tienda_Online_de_videojuegos_(proyecto_integrador).ipynb
As an analyst for the Ice online store, which sells video games worldwide, your task is to identify patterns that determine whether a game is successful or not. By analyzing user and expert reviews, game genres, platforms (e.g., Xbox, PlayStation), and historical sales data, you will gain insights to detect promising projects and optimize marketing campaigns.

The dataset contains sales data up to 2016, and your goal is to use these insights to plan a 2017 marketing campaign. While the actual year of prediction does not impact the methodology, the focus is on developing data-driven forecasting skills.

The dataset also includes the "rating" column, which contains ESRB classifications (Entertainment Software Rating Board). This rating system categorizes games based on age suitability, such as Teen (T) or Mature (M).

P7. Travel Data Analysis â€“ Zuber https://github.com/Lalo8Ortiz/-Data-Analysis/blob/main/P7_Recopilacion_Almacenamiento_de_datos_SQL.ipynb
I analyzed taxi usage patterns in Chicago to identify the impact of weather on travel demand. I integrated multiple data sources and conducted exploratory analysis using SQL and Python, validating hypotheses through statistical testing.
